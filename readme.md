This repo served mainly for flashcard purpose, which help myself to memorize concept 
under certain language / framework context like other repo under thise account.   
   
Source code are originised in following way, noted that most example 
in here are heavily commented, so should be just fine to randomly dive 
in certain concept let say concurrent programming and start to learn:


* [Advanced](./src/advanced):   
    Advanced concept that is good to know as senior Java Dev, stuff like how GC work, 
    usage of reflection and few SUN package.  
* [Code Pattern](./src/codePattern):   
    Java is mean to be a OOP language, as time passed. Functional programming 
    introduced Java8 onward. This package would talk about both.
* [Com](./src/com):   
    Which is a 1 to 1 mapping to original src code. Let say wanna know more BigDecimal
    which having **java.math.BigDecimal** as package name. Then the relavant Src code example
    would be placed under the idential package path which is **com.lang.math.simpleUsage**.
* [Design-Pattern](./src/designPattern):   
    Varies implementation of software pattern.
* [Fundamental](./src/fundamental):   
    Base code that u would be writting day after day. It's a good entry point 
    for those who are interested in Java.

package concurrent.conceptual.Deadlock;

/*
 * Following package is trying present you how deadlock can happen when 
 * ReentrantLock is handled in a proper manner. 
 * 
 * In this example two threads are interacting with two a/c 
 * for transfer money concurrently, when the initial approach implemented.
 * It may happen that each thread kept one lock each and both of them
 * wait to obtain to other one. Hence they are waiting each other, till one 
 * gave up, but it wouldn't happen. 
 * 
 * So the better the approach is try to obtain lock and only proceed when
 * both lock obtain, either one lock fail would lead to release of 
 * the existing lock. 
 * 
 *  May cause more resources to dealt the such situation, at least it work?

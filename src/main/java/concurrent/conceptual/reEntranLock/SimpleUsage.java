/**
 * Following example simply used to demonstrate how a lock can be used in real world application.
 * In this example, customer class contain a ReentrantLock. Sclesman can only sale goods to customer,
 * when they successfully obtain the lock. 
 * 
 * So it mean only one sales can sale to one customer in one time. It make sense right?
 * And other salesman can't sale to the customer who reentrantLock is locked. 
 * 
 * In this First salesman try to sale Mac to Andy for first 3 seconds. And Acer sales try to sale 
 * acer laptop after 2s and ohho no luck cuz locked obtained by Apple sales.

/* Following show the usage of synchronized keyword, 
 * Each thread run for loop 1000 times to increment, the amount of count.
 * However as var count belong to parent class, but the time thread_1 fetch, ++ and increment it.
 * Thread_2 may incremented for several times already, but over-write by Thread_1 (Over-lapped)
 * There for result is less what it should be. 
 * 
 * By adopting the synchronized keyword, lock is established on class creation and 
 * only one entry is allowed for access, hence by the time Thread_1 incrementing the 
 * count, Thread_2 need to queue up for it.

/**
 * This demo can be used to demonstrate how future can be used in actual application.
 * In this example, getPrice( ) have choice to return future<Double> instead of normal 
 * Double, so consumer have choice to work on others first and come back later.
 * 
 * Also two patterns of parallelism can be found. First one is parallel stream, which 
 * multiple thread on client side is used to retrieve result. The result list only be 
 * acquired when all thread have answer from their end-point which is Shop class in this example. 
 * 
 * The other approach would be having the implementation over end-point which is future,
 * in this situation, sever would return a reference call future<Double> which is the token 
 * to retireve the final result, as the result is not available yet upon request time.
 * So client sequentially launch other task and only check the result when it finish all the
 * remaining.

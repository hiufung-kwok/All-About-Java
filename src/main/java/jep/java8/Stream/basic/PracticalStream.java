* 
* This segment of code used to demonstrate how to stream of data in just one line manner. Which would be 
* useful especailly for testing purpose, also random stream can be used for testing-purpose (Fuzzing). 
* 
* 
* This the most common one would be ```IntStream.rangeClose()``` and ```IntStream.range``` which both of 
* the call take two arg, seed and the threadhold to stop. Let say 1, 1000 passed in. The method would 
* return [1,1000] -> 1...1000 || [1, 1000) 1...999 depends of the call type. [Url to Example]
* 
* It come into handy when a sequence of number is needed for test-case but just too troublesome to 
* tpye int arr = new int[](1,2,3.....); 999% time saver.
* 
* Above method call only work for sequentially int. What happen you want some thing in pattern? Stuff
* like every even number from 0 to 500;
* 
* In this sense the ```ObjStream.iterate()``` and ```Stream.limit()``` would come into help. By combine 
* both call, it's capable to produce stream of number that fullfill your pattern. Example can be
* seen on [URL]. Just noted that ```iterate( )``` by itself is a finite Stream, just beware of it. 
* And personally personing I wouldn't prefer to use it on production. A finite stream would make 
* all downStream processing method keep working forever and you program basically screwed.

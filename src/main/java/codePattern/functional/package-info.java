 * Properties:
 * 	- Declarative code -> More readable?
 * 		- It do have problem as no state is stored. Result tend to be done in one off manner.
 * 
 * catch?
 * 	- 
 * 
 * Why Functional Programming:
 * 	- This fits naturally with concurrency and parallelism applicability. 
 * 	- Reduce redundant code? (Less boilerplate)
 * 		- When code is state-less and only implement some behaviors. No need a class, the primary 
 * 		purpose of class is store data in an unit. 
 * 		- Pointless of implements an method or extend a class just for its one line function.
 * 		- Lambda expressions are used to express a function directly in code without the need of object-oriented wrappers

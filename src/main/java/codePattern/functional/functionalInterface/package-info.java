/**
 *	- It's an interface in Java that has only one abstract method
 *
 *	- Lamabda expressions only work with functional interfaces
 *
 * 	- Key construct to let Java support functional programming. (Get rid of unnecessary wrapper)
 * 	Instead of wrapping a method call with boilerplate class and interface.
 * 	Cuz Javac would handle it for you to separate it to distinct .class file. 
 * 
 *  - It's take an object as input, so versions of functional interfaces
 *  for primitive types exist, stuff like: IntConsumer instead of Consumer<X>
